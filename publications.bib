	abstract = {Understanding how regulatory DNA elements shape gene expression across individual cells is a fundamental challenge in genomics. Joint RNA-seq and epigenomic profiling provides opportunities to build unifying models of gene regulation capturing sequence determinants across steps of gene expression. However, current models, developed primarily for bulk omics data, fail to capture the cellular heterogeneity and dynamic processes revealed by single-cell multi-modal technologies. Here, we introduce scooby, the first model to predict scRNA-seq coverage and scATAC-seq insertion profiles along the genome from sequence at single-cell resolution. For this, we leverage the pre-trained multi-omics profile predictor Borzoi as a foundation model, equip it with a cell-specific decoder, and fine-tune its sequence embeddings. Specifically, we condition the decoder on the cell position in a precomputed single-cell embedding resulting in strong generalization capability. Applied to a hematopoiesis dataset, scooby recapitulates cell-specific expression levels of held-out genes and cells, and identifies regulators and their putative target genes through in silico motif deletion. Moreover, accurate variant effect prediction with scooby allows for breaking down bulk eQTL effects into single-cell effects and delineating their impact on chromatin accessibility and gene expression. We anticipate scooby to aid unraveling the complexities of gene regulation at the resolution of individual cells.},

	abstract = {Single-cell ATAC sequencing coverage in regulatory regions is typically binarized as an indicator of open chromatin. Here we show that binarization is an unnecessary step that neither improves goodness of fit, clustering, cell type identification nor batch integration. Fragment counts, but not read counts, should instead be modeled, which preserves quantitative regulatory information. These results have immediate implications for single-cell ATAC sequencing analysis.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in single-cell technologies have enabled high-throughput molecular profiling of cells across modalities and locations. Single-cell transcriptomics data can now be complemented by chromatin accessibility, surface protein expression, adaptive immune receptor repertoire profiling and spatial information. The increasing availability of single-cell data across modalities has motivated the development of novel computational methods to help analysts derive biological insights. As the field grows, it becomes increasingly difficult to navigate the vast landscape of tools and analysis steps. Here, we summarize independent benchmarking studies of unimodal and multimodal single-cell analysis across modalities to suggest comprehensive best-practice workflows for the most common analysis steps. Where independent benchmarks are not available, we review and contrast popular methods. Our article serves as an entry point for novices in the field of single-cell (multi-)omic analysis and guides advanced users to the most recent best practices.},
