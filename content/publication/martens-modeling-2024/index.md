abstract: Single-cell ATAC sequencing coverage in regulatory regions is typically
  binarized as an indicator of open chromatin. Here we show that binarization is an
  unnecessary step that neither improves goodness of fit, clustering, cell type identification
  nor batch integration. Fragment counts, but not read counts, should instead be modeled,
  which preserves quantitative regulatory information. These results have immediate
  implications for single-cell ATAC sequencing analysis.
