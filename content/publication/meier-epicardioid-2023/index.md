abstract: The epicardium, the mesothelial envelope of the vertebrate heart, is the
  source of multiple cardiac cell lineages during embryonic development and provides
  signals that are essential to myocardial growth and repair. Here we generate self-organizing
  human pluripotent stem cell-derived epicardioids that display retinoic acid-dependent
  morphological, molecular and functional patterning of the epicardium and myocardium
  typical of the left ventricular wall. By combining lineage tracing, single-cell
  transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility profiling, we describe the specification
  and differentiation process of different cell lineages in epicardioids and draw
  comparisons to human fetal development at the transcriptional and morphological
  levels. We then use epicardioids to investigate the functional cross-talk between
  cardiac cell types, gaining new insights into the role of IGF2/IGF1R and NRP2 signaling
  in human cardiogenesis. Finally, we show that epicardioids mimic the multicellular
  pathogenesis of congenital or stress-induced hypertrophy and fibrotic remodeling.
  As such, epicardioids offer a unique testing ground of epicardial activity in heart
  development, disease and regeneration.
